Qualitative modeling including both Monte carlo simulation approach and Boolean approach.  

The qualitative modeling approach with Boolean analysis is developed by Nadiah Kristensen et. al. (2019). The R code is derived from the original Python code written by Nadiah Kristensen (see https://github.com/nadiahpk/qualitative-modelling/tree/master/tutorials).
